# Threat recheck 2026-10-08 fixes — handoff

Plan: [`docs/threat_recheck_2026_10_08_plan.md`](threat_recheck_2026_10_08_plan.md)
("Run 2026-10-08" section). Branch `threat/1008`, worktree
`.claude/worktrees/threat1008`. Each implementer and reviewer appends a short
section: commits (shas), files, tests added, gates with results and test
counts, choices made, gotchas, and "Flagged for user".

## Agent step 1 — implementer (gap 16, A1 per-scope)

**Commit:** `6b0e0649` Stop sharing dotenv and config files as agent logins.

**Files:** `src-tauri/src/commands/agents.rs` (Cline, Vibe, aider,
mini-swe-agent `auth_paths: &[]`; `auth_paths` doc comment; CodeBuddy/Kimi
rows name their `DirNames`), `src-tauri/src/services/agent_auth.rs`
(`AuthKind::Dir(DirNames)`, `DirNames::{Json, CodeBuddyInfo}::admits`,
allowlist in `reconcile_dir`, `status_in` signed-in and importable,
`remove_copies`, import's one-level `copy_dir_logins` replacing the recursive
`copy_dir`; `RETIRED` + `retire_shared_paths_in`/`retire_dir_names`; module
docs), `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` (`retire_shared_paths()` before
`import_once`), `services/agent_home.rs` (stale "hard-linked" prose),
`commands/ollama.rs` (comment), English + de/es/fr/it
`settings.agentLoginsHelp`, `docs/help/agent-clis.md` (Sign in + API-key
paragraph), `docs/context/agent_authority.md` (item 4 + "One login per
CLI"), `docs/filemap_backend.md` (`agent_auth.rs` row),
`docs/third_party_update_checklist.md`, `docs/threat_model.md` row 16
(**Fixed, not live-verified.** with the residual).

**Tests added** (`agent_auth.rs`): `no_registry_row_shares_an_env_or_config_file`,
`retiring_a_shared_path_keeps_scope_copies_and_clears_the_hosts` (store dir
gone; fenced and `.local` copies kept; Host copy equal to the store removed,
Host copy equal to its `.placed` record removed, divergent Host copy kept; a
later scope write no longer spreads; second run a no-op),
`retiring_drops_unlisted_names_from_login_folders`,
`a_login_directory_shares_only_allowlisted_names` (Kimi temp + `x.env`,
CodeBuddy backup + `.logged-out` neither adopted nor placed, nor counted as
signed in), `dir_names_admit_only_the_login_file_shapes`,
`import_copies_only_allowlisted_names_of_a_login_folder`. Updated:
`a_local_model_home_receives_logins_but_never_feeds_them_back` now uses
`.codex/auth.json`; `a_login_directory_is_reconciled_file_by_file` uses
`kimi-code.json`.

**Gates (at `6b0e0649`):** `npm run build` ok; `npm test` 735 files / 7555
tests passed; `cargo test` 3733 passed, 3 ignored, 0 failed (lib 3565 +
integration); `npm run lint` 0 errors, 28 advisory warnings (none in touched
files; no TS logic changed); `cargo clippy --all-targets -D warnings` clean;
`scripts/brand-check.sh` ok; `git diff --check` clean;
`scripts/privacy-check.sh` clean. `npm run backend:stale` not run (main
agent at landing).

**Choices:**
- The allowlist is an enum (`DirNames`) on `AuthKind::Dir`, not a fn pointer,
  so `AuthPath` keeps its derives without fn-pointer comparisons.
- `retire_shared_paths_in` keys on the retired CLI's store dir existing (no
  marker). If removing the Host copy fails, the store dir is kept so the
  next start can still tell Tabtivity's copy from the Host session's own.
- The Host-copy check compares the raw file digest with the store file's
  digest and with `.placed/host/<leaf>`.
- Folder cleanup removes a home's unlisted name only where its digest equals
  that home's placed record, then deletes the unlisted store files and their
  `.placed/*/<leaf>_<name>` records in every record dir.
- `status_in.importable` for a login folder now means "holds an admitted
  file", so an import of a folder with only strays reports the existing
  "no login file" error instead of copying nothing.
- No `UntestedTag`: no new UI; Settings drops the four CLIs from the
  shared-login list by `LoginStatus.shared` alone.
- Test fixtures use neutral `VIBE_FIXTURE`/`AIDER_FIXTURE` names, not API-key variable names, which
  the privacy check flags.

**Gotchas:** the first cargo build in this worktree took over 10 minutes; a
foreground `timeout 590` run printed nothing. Run cargo in the background.

**Flagged for user:**
- Vibe, Aider, mini-swe-agent and Cline now sign in once per project. Existing
  project homes keep the login they had; the Host session loses a copy
  Tabtivity put there. One key everywhere: put the file into the global agent
  config (Settings → Agent sandbox → Global agent config → Open folder).
- Residual (row 16): content planted before the fix stays in the fenced homes
  it reached; Goose `secrets.yaml`, OpenCode `auth.json`, Qoder `.auth` are
  still shared on the 2026-09-25 survey, not re-surveyed.
- Not live-verified; the allowlists are read off CodeBuddy 2.162.0 and Kimi
  Code 2.1.1 bundles. A newer CLI that renames its login file would stop
  being shared (fails safe: it signs in per project).
