# macOS / Windows completion — handoff

Plan: `docs/macos_windows_completion_plan.md`. One section per agent step,
written by the implementer and amended by the reviewer. Newest at the bottom.

## Baseline (develop a6ed2c7a, 2026-10-07)

- Worktree: `.claude/worktrees/osfix-a1`, branch `osfix/a1`.
- Test counts: (filled by the main agent from the baseline runs)

## Flagged for user

(design doubts and anything a reviewer would not fix in code)

## A1 — 3.1 + 3.2

Commit: the one that carries this section — `git log -1 --format=%h -- docs/macos_windows_completion_handoff.md` on `osfix/a1` (one commit for the step).

Per file:
- `src/components/files/FileTree.tsx` — rename retarget derives the new path as
  `resolvePath(dirname(oldAbs), nextName)` (keeps `C:\` roots and the entry's
  separator style).
- `src/stores/tabs.ts` — `retargetTabs` compares with `relativePathWithin`
  (both separators, segment boundaries, case-insensitive on Windows) and
  prefix-swaps with `resolvePath`; labels via `basename`.
- `src/components/monitoring/DiskUsagePane.tsx` — `parentDir` is
  `dirname(path) || "/"` (now exported for the test); picked-folder label via
  `basename`.
- `src/components/files/RenameDialog.tsx` — `containingFolderLabel` is
  `basename(dirname(absPath)) || rootLabel`.
- `src/components/embed/deck/DeckView.tsx` — three `.split("/").pop()` labels
  → `basename(x) || x` (lines 952/1045/1185 of the base).
- `src/components/embed/deck/DeckPresenter.tsx` — stale "Linux-only … TODO V
  #121" comment replaced by what `presenter.rs` does per OS.
- `src/lib/terminal/pythonRun.ts` — `currentPlatform()` = `IS_WINDOWS ?
  "windows" : "unix"` from `lib/platform`.
- `src/lib/terminal/shellScriptRun.ts` — `shellRunCommand` quotes with
  `pythonRun.shellQuote(scriptRel, "windows")` for `powershell`/`cmd`, `'…'`
  (same helper, `"unix"`) for the POSIX shells; the exported `shellQuote`
  (used by `DevBuildIndicator`) is unchanged in behaviour.
- `src/lib/terminal/pathLinks.ts` — `PATH_SHAPE` takes `[\\/]` separators
  and an optional `[A-Za-z]:` drive root; `//`/`\\` rejection via
  `DOUBLE_SEP`; leaf via `basename`; `EXTENSION` excludes `\` as well.
- `src/__tests__/run/ShellScriptRun.test.ts` — the two expectations that
  codified `'…'` for PowerShell/cmd fixed; `C:\p\run.bat`, `""` doubling and a
  Windows-root `shellScriptRunPlan` case added.
- `src/__tests__/files/WindowsPaths.test.ts` (new) — `containingFolderLabel`,
  `parentDir`, the FileTree composition, `retargetTabs` with `C:\p\a.txt` →
  `C:\p\b.txt`, a directory rename, `subway`-vs-`sub` boundary, case folding.
- `src/__tests__/terminal/PathLinks.test.tsx` — Windows shapes added; the
  existing POSIX fixtures are untouched and still pass.
- `todo/group-h-crossplatform.md` — 🖐️ entry 32p with the four platform
  children (§1 rule), under the 2026-09-03 sweep.

Choices where the plan left room:
- A bare leading `\` is **not** a path root in `PATH_SHAPE` (`\section`,
  `\textbf` would otherwise go to the backend on every TeX line). `C:\…`,
  `.\…`, `..\…` and `a\b` are. UNC `\\server\share` is rejected like `//`.
- The "candidates are `normalizePath`ed before `relativePathWithin`" bullet
  needed no code: `relativePathWithin`/`isPathWithin` already normalize both
  sides internally, and the only paths that reach them in `pathLinks.ts` are
  the backend's `entry.path`.
- Backend `resolve_text_paths` (`fs.rs:153`): read-verified, no change.
  `Path::new(candidate)` parses `\` and drive prefixes on Windows;
  `normalize_lexical` folds `.\`; a `\`-rooted candidate without a drive
  joins to the base's drive and then fails `strip_prefix` → `None`. On Linux a
  `\` is a filename byte, so a stray candidate just does not exist.
- `parentDir` was exported from `DiskUsagePane.tsx` (same pattern as
  `RenameDialog.containingFolderLabel`) rather than moved: decision 2 forbids
  new path helpers.
- No `UntestedTag` pill: nothing new is rendered; the 🖐️ todo line carries
  the verification.

Gotchas:
- `normalizePath("C:/p/x")` emits `C:\p\x` by design (drive ⇒ `\`), so do
  not assert forward-slash drive paths survive; the backend never emits them.
- `DevBuildIndicator.tsx` imports `shellQuote` from `shellScriptRun` — keep
  that export POSIX (A2 touches that file).
- Lint warning line numbers in `DiskUsagePane.tsx`/`DeckView.tsx` shift by one
  (one import line each); the warning set is identical (28 → 28).

Gates (worktree, 2026-10-07):

| `npm test` | 729 files / 7519 tests passed (baseline 728 / 7507) |
| `npm run lint` | 0 errors, 28 warnings before and after (same set) |
| `scripts/brand-check.sh` | pass |
| `git diff --check` | clean |
| `cargo test` / `cargo clippy` | not run: no `src-tauri/` change in this step (read-only check of `fs.rs`) |

### Reviewer

Verified by feeding the brief's inputs through a throwaway vitest probe
(deleted; nothing launched):
- `retargetTabs`: `C:\p\a.txt` → `C:\p\b.txt` (path + label), `C:\p\dir`
  → `C:\p\dir2` with a tab at `C:\p\dir\x.md` (and one already at
  `C:\p\dir2\y.md`, untouched), `/p/a` → `/p/b`, `/p/dir` → `/p/dir2` with
  `/p/dir2/x` **not** retargeted (segment boundary), `/p/Dir/y` untouched on
  POSIX (case stays significant). All correct.
- `pathLinks.ts`: the six existing POSIX fixture lines give byte-identical
  candidate lists; `\section{x}`, `\textbf`, `\\server\share\x.md`, `a//b.md`,
  `a\\b.md`, `C:\`, `D:` yield no candidate; `\includegraphics{fig/a.pdf}`
  still yields `fig/a.pdf` as before. New on POSIX: a single-letter
  `h:/x.txt` is now a candidate (drive root by design) — harmless, the backend
  lookup decides what links.
- `shellRunCommand`: `cmd /c "C:\p dir\run.bat" x "y"` (args verbatim, as
  documented), `powershell -File "scripts/a b.ps1" -N 1`, POSIX unchanged
  (`bash 'a b.sh' x`, `zsh 'it'\''s.sh'`).
- `parentDir`: `C:\a` → `C:\`, `/a` → `/`, `/` → `/`, `C:\` → `/` (same as
  before the step; unreachable — the only caller passes `node.is_dir ?
  node.path : parentDir(node.path)`, so a root never reaches it).
- Imports: no new cycle (`shellScriptRun` → `pythonRun` → `stores/tabs`;
  `tabs.ts` imports neither); `FileTree.tsx` already imported
  `dirname`/`resolvePath`.

Fixed (one commit, this one): `retargetTabs` turned a POSIX tab path holding
a `\` into `/`-joined segments — `/p/dir/we\ird.md` under a `/p/dir` →
`/p/dir2` rename became `/p/dir2/we/ird.md` (the old prefix-swap kept it; a
`\` is a legal byte in a Linux file name and `relativePathWithin` reads any
`\` as a separator). An exact-prefix match (`oldAbs` + `/` or `\`) now keeps
the tail byte-for-byte; only a case-folded or mixed-separator match goes
through `resolvePath`. Regression test in
`src/__tests__/files/FileTabSync.test.ts` (also pins `/p/sub2` ∉ `/p/sub`).

Gates (worktree, after the fix):
| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm run build` | green |
| `npm test` | 729 files / 7520 tests passed |
| `npm run lint` | 0 errors, 28 warnings (same set) |
| `scripts/brand-check.sh` | pass |
| `git diff --check` | clean |
| `cargo test` / `cargo clippy` | not run: no `src-tauri/` change |

### Flagged for user

- `cmd /c "scripts/run.bat"` (forward slash, no space): cmd's `/c` rule strips
  the outer quotes when the quoted string has no whitespace, and cmd then
  tokenises an unquoted `scripts/run.bat` at the `/` ("'scripts' is not
  recognized …" — the known npm-on-cmd gotcha); typed into a PowerShell tab
  the quotes are dropped the same way. The plan fixes the project-relative
  `scriptRel` (backend `/` convention), so the step is as specified, but the
  `.bat` Run button may still fail on Windows until `scriptRel` is emitted
  with `\` for the `cmd`/`powershell` interpreters. Not verifiable here —
  needs the 32p manual test on Windows; a one-line
  `scriptRel.replace(/\//g, "\\")` in `shellRunCommand`'s Windows branch
  would be the fix if it fails.
- `relativePathWithin`/`isPathWithin` (shared helpers, not this step) read any
  `\` as a Windows separator; FileTree and other callers inherit the same
  blind spot for POSIX names containing `\`. Only `retargetTabs` is fixed
  here (it had a byte-exact predecessor); the rest is pre-existing.
